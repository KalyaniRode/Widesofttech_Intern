       *BACKGROUND SHORTHAND*

# The CSS background shorthand property allows you to define multiple background-related properties in a single declaration, 
simplifying the styling process and improving code readability.

# It essentially combines several individual background properties like ,
background-color, background-image, background-repeat, background-attachment, and background-position into one concise property. 

#  Example:  background: #f0f0f0 url("image.png") no-repeat top right;
