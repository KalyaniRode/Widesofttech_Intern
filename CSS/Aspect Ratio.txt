 **ASPECT RATIO**
    
The aspect-ratio property in CSS is used to control the proportion between the width and height of an element.
It ensures the element keeps the same shape even when resized.
For example, 16 / 9 is common for videos, 1 / 1 is for squares.

Syntax:
 selector {
    aspect-ratio: width / height;
}
   aspect-ratio keeps width and height in a fixed proportion, 
   making layouts simple and consistent.
